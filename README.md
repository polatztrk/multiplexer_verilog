# multiplexer_verilog

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a multiplexer (MUX). A multiplexer is a digital logic circuit that selects one of several inputs and forwards the selected input as the output.

## Introduction

In this project, we have designed a 2-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog HDL. The multiplexer selects one of two inputs (Data_0 and Data_1) based on the value of the control signal (Sel). The selected data is then presented at the output (Y).
